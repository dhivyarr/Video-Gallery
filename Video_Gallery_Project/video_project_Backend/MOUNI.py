Birds are animals that have feathers, wings, and beaks. They are warm-blooded and lay eggs. Birds are often found in the sky, trees, and on the ground, and they come in various shapes, sizes, and colors. For Class 1 students, learning about birds can help them understand more about nature and the world around them.
